# Team Project: Color Flipper
Today's assignment we will divide everyone into groups to complete this Color Flipper challenge. This challenge will be utilizing DOM manipulation as well as other methods we've used within JavaScript. You will be given most of the day to work on this project.

## Instructions
You are given the task to create a Color Flipper application. You will be provided with the CSS so you don't have to worry about that, however, we need to create our HTML files and JavaScript files. You will first be given the chance to create a simple color generator and then once that is completed, you will be given the chance to improve and expand upon your project with the hex code generator portion.

### User Story
```
1. It is done when I have a properly working Simple Color Flipper.
2. It is done when I have a navbar with a title and two links (html files)--one for simple.html and one for hex.html.
3. It is done when I have a main body for the application.
4. Inside of that body, there should be a title for the background color and the value.
5. Also inside of the main, there should be a button that will allow the user to click through different colors.
6. You need two JS files: simple.js and hex.js.
7. In the simple.js file, you will need an array of at least 5 colors your simple color logic can go through.
8. In the hex.js file, you need to figure out how to generate random hex codes.
9. It is done when I can click through different colors.
